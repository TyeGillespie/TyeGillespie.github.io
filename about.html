    <h1><em>My Journey</em></h1>
    <p>
      <strong><em>As a teenager,</em></strong> &nbsp;I dreamt about having a
      great career as a computer engineer, setting and accomlishing goals,
      traveling the world and enjoying life to the fullest. At the age of 14 and
      a sophomore in high school, I joined an engineer club for minorities
      called: National Society of Black Engineers. This club enabled me to
      travel around the United States to attend conferences and network with
      professionals in various engineering fields while socializing with other
      students in different chapters of the club. I loved this club because I
      atteneded seminars where speakers would encourage the youth to persevere
      through our social economic status and persue our dreams as engineers.
      Unfortunately, at the age of 17, I made a bad decision that cost me my
      freedom and the ability to experience the most important pasrt of my life
      in society.

      &nbsp;Not only did i no longer have the immediate finacial, mental, and
      emotional support of my family, but also a large percentage of my life
      would be spent in prison. Growing up in prison forced me to mature fast.
      Many different factors come into play while trying to grow up in a
      confined, very unnatural,toxic, and small community of only women such as:
      personalities, cultural beliefs/ practices, gender identities, age
      differences, mental health disorders, not to mention the abusive staff
      members that arbitrarily enforce idiotic rules to gain control of an
      already oppressed population. Maturing in prison for me was a difficult
      and long process. However, after 5 years of doing drugs and being involved
      in both abusive friendships and relationships; I ended up getting into
      trouble for smoking THC and spent sixty days in solitary confinement
      a.k.a. The Box. While in the Box, I started reading spiritual books such
      as the Quran, praying, and meditating. While I enjoyed the stories of the
      Quran, i took solice and found serenity in the quiet of my meditation.
      Initially, finding that sense of calm and control was difficult.Racing
      thoughts, the ability to sit in one place for an extended time made my
      early meditation attempts difficult. However, after continued practice,
      meditation became and remains a routine part of my day.

      <strong><em>No matter what chaos i'am surrounded by,</em></strong> &nbsp;I
      always find peace when I take the time to meditate. Over time i've noticed
      the decrease of my stress levels, increse in concentration and focus, a
      better sleeping pattern, an increase in my tolerance for people, a sense
      of calm, and an increase in my overall happiness. Those results are enough
      to encourage me to continue meditation and encourage others to begin their
      own journey into the world of meditation.
